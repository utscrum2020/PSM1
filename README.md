Definition of Scrum 

Scrum is one of the most popular agile methods. Scrum is a lightweight, iterative, and incremental framework for managing complex work. Scrum is lightweight, easy to understand, but difficult to master. It often gets misunderstood as a method, technique, or process, but scrum is a framework, within which one can employ various processes and techniques to productively and creatively deliver products giving maximum possible value.
It is an adaptive, iterative, fast, flexible, and effective framework designed to deliver significant value quickly and throughout a project. Scrum ensures transparency in communication and creates an environment of collective accountability and continuous progress.

History of Scrum

In 1986, at Harvard Business Review article, Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka introduced the term scrum in the context of product development.
Schwaber and Tunde researched on the scrum framework and advised that complex products that are not developed based on the Empiricism are prone to high risk. Also, Rates of failure increases as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, which uses frequent inspection, adaptation, flexibility, and transparency, is the most suitable approach.
Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland co-presented the Scrum at the OOPSLA Conference in 1995. This presentation essentially documented the learning that Ken and Jeff gained over the previous few years. The first formal definition of the Scrum was made public at that time.
The Scrum Alliance was founded by Schwaber, with others and set up as the Certified Scrum accreditation series in the year 2002. Schwaber later founded Scrum.org in 2009.
The Scrum Guide has been published and updated by Schwaber and Sutherland in 2009. Its latest version is available since 2017 after its fifth revision.

Scrum Theory 

•	Transparency
-Information radiators (Scrum board, Sprint Burndown Chart) are shared across the teams to facilitate an open work environment
-Helps in getting the same understanding of the Definition of Done across the scrum team
•	Inspection
- Identifies the progress of the Scrum Team in the current sprint
•	Adaption
-	Ability to stay open to take feedback and make changes keeping sprint goal into mind
-	Minimizes the risk of further deviation from achieving the goal
These are the three pillars of the scrum, which makes the Empiricism based approach feasible. It employs an iterative, incremental approach to minimize the risk and maximize the predictability. 

Transparency, inspection, and adaption can be achieved when the scrum team follows the scrum values.
•	Commitment for achieving goals of the scrum team
•	Courage to face hard times and to take the right approach
•	Focus  on the goal planned for the sprint
•	Openness  to openly discuss issues/ targets with stockholder and scrum team
•	Respect towards each member of the scrum team for their capability

Scrum Team

A scrum team consists of 
•	Product Owner: He or she is the person responsible for achieving maximum business value for the project, articulating customer requirements, and maintaining business justification for the project. The Product Owner represents the Voice of the Customer.

•	Scrum Master: He or she is a facilitator who ensures that the Scrum Team gets an environment suitable enough to complete the project successfully. 
The Scrum Master 
-guides the Scrum team
-facilitates scrum events
-teaches Scrum practices
-clears impediments for the team
-ensures implementation of Scrum processes 

•	Development team: It is the group of people who understand the requirements specified by the Product Owner and creates a product that meets the definition of done.
The main characteristic of the scrum team is to be independent, self-sufficient by not relying on outside members for any problem resolutions. Such teams are cross-functional and self-organizing. The team itself has all the skills to gain the expected outcome. This outcome is a potentially releasable working version, achieved by continuous on-time delivery, feedback, and improvement.  

    
                  
Figure 1.Scrum Team Roles

The Product Owner
A product owner can handle multiple products, but for each scrum team, there can be only one product owner.
The product owner has the following responsibilities
•	Define the product by reviewing and understanding customer requirements
•	manage product backlog
•	Add them to the Product Backlog
•	prioritize them based on importance and dependencies
•	make sure that each item is visible and transparent to the team
•	maximize the value of the product

The Scrum Mater 
His ultimate goal is to get scrum implemented across the organization by educating everyone about scrum processes.
He acts as a medium between the product owner and the rest of the team.
The scrum master does the following jobs: 
•	He works along with the product owner to manage product backlog when needed
•     He focuses on making development team self-organizing and cross-functional by enhancing their skills and arranging sessions for the same
•	Remove blockers that the scrum team faces by coordinating with concerned stakeholders
•	Increase the awareness of Scrum in the organization by collaborating with other scrum masters and by educating stakeholders

The Development Team
Scrum doesn’t recognize titles or roles among the development team. The entire team as a whole is responsible for delivery and success or failure. The team has all the right to choose from product backlogs items for the coming spring and provide estimates for the same. Only the development team decides what it can work upon for the given sprint.
The small size of the development team may not have enough skills to meet the goal and the big size of the development team can be tough to handle at times. As per scrum, the preferred size for the development team should be between 3 and 9 (this does not consider product owner and scrum master unless they are involved in direct execution of any goal items).

Scrum Events

Scrum events are time-boxed i.e. they have a maximum time limit defined to achieve the defined set of tasks. The length of the sprint is decided in advance and is normally between one week and one month. The usual length of the sprint is two weeks. Once the sprint duration is defined, it can not be changed.
The rest of the event has a maximum duration defined but can be marked completed before time if the purpose is served. The scrum events provide the opportunity to plan, implement, and review or revise the work done to meet the objectives without getting deviated from the path of achieving sprint goal making it transparent and adaptive.

The below diagram explains how scrum event works.

 
Figure 2.Scrum Events

The Sprint 
The purpose of the sprint is to gain potentially releasable product increment which is in a working condition, usable, and meets the definition of done. Sprint is delivered through different phases like sprint planning, daily scrum, development, spring review, and sprint retrospective. 
Once sprint goals are defined, they can be negotiated between the product owner and development team as the work progresses and more clarity is available. But this should not put the sprint goal in danger such that the quality of the goal is sacrificed. 

Canceling a sprint
Given a situation, the product owner has the right to cancel the sprint. The development team, scrum master, or stakeholders anyone may ask the product owner to take such a decision. This may take place when stakeholders may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint as market changes or product demand changes, or the development team doesn't find it feasible to match product requirements. In case of abnormal termination of the sprint, newsprint planning takes place, where the reason for the sprint cancellation is reviewed. 

Sprint Planning
This meeting is conducted before the Sprint to commit user stories; identify tasks, estimate tasks, and create sprint backlog processes. 
It is Time boxed to eight hours for a one month Sprint. The Sprint Planning Meeting is divided into two parts: 
1. Objective Definition: during the first part of the meeting, the Product Owner explains the highest priority User Stories or requirements in the Prioritized Product Backlog to the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team in collaboration with the Product Owner then commits to the User Stories, which define the Sprint goal. 
2. Task Identification and Estimation: the Scrum Team then decides how to complete the selected Prioritized Product Backlog Items to fulfill the Sprint goal. The committed user stories and related effort estimated tasks are included in the sprint backlog to be tracked.

What Is a Sprint Goal? 

Each sprint can be summarized by a sprint goal that describes the business purpose and value of the sprint. Typically the sprint goal has a clear, single focus, such as 
-Support initial report generation. 
-Demonstrate the ability to send a text message through integrated software, firmware, and hardware stack.
There are times when a sprint goal might be multifaceted, for example, “Get basic printing working and support search by date.” 
During sprint planning, the development team should help refine and agree to the sprint goal and use it to determine the product backlog items that it can complete by the end of the sprint. These product backlog items serve to further elaborate on the sprint goal.

Daily Scrum 

Each day of the sprint, ideally at the same time, the development team members hold a time-boxed (15 minutes or less) daily scrum. This inspect-and adapt activity is sometimes referred to as the daily stand-up because of the common practice of everyone standing up during the meeting to help promote brevity.
A common approach to performing the daily scrum has the Scrum Master facilitating and each team member taking turns answering three questions for the benefit of the other team members:
•	What did I accomplish since the last daily scrum? 
•	What do I plan to work on by the next daily scrum?
•	 What are the obstacles or impediments that are preventing me from making progress?
 By answering these questions, everyone understands the big picture of what is occurring, how they are progressing toward the sprint goal, any modifications they want to make to their plans for the upcoming day’s work, and what issues need to be addressed. The daily scrum is essential for helping the development team manage the fast, flexible flow of work within a sprint. The daily scrum is not a problem-solving activity. A daily scrum however can be useful to communicate the status of sprint backlog items among the development team members. Mainly, the daily scrum is an inspection, synchronization, and adaptive daily planning activity that helps a self-organizing team do its job better.

Sprint Review 

The Sprint Review Meeting is Time-boxed to four hours for a one month Sprint. During the Sprint Review Meeting that is conducted in the Demonstrate and Validate the Sprint process, the Scrum Team presents the deliverables of the current Sprint to the Product Owner. The Product Owner reviews the product (or product increment) against the agreed acceptance criteria and either accepts or rejects the completed user stories. 

Sprint Retrospective 

The Retrospect Sprint Meeting is Time-boxed to three hours for a one month Sprint and conducted as part of the retrospect sprint process. During this meeting, the Scrum Team gets together to review and reflect on the previous Sprint in terms of the processes followed, tools employed, collaboration and communication mechanisms, and other aspects relevant to the project. The team discusses what went well during the previous Sprint and what did not go well, the goal being to learn and make improvements in the Sprints to follow. 

Scrum Artifacts

Scrum Artifacts provide key information that the Scrum Team and the stakeholders need to be aware of for understanding the product under development, the activities done, and the activities being planned in the project.
The Product Backlog
The product backlog is a breakdown of work to be done and contains an ordered list of product requirements that a scrum team maintains for a product. The requirements define features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements, etc. whatever must be done to deliver a viable product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, size and date needed.
The product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.
The product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points or time. By estimating story points, the team reduces the dependency on individual developers. 

The product backlog:

•	Captures requests to modify a product -including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues
•	Ensures the development team has work that maximizes the business benefit to the product owner
Backlog refinement (grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity.
•	Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones
•	 Acceptance criteria may be clarified
•	Dependencies may be identified and investigated
The backlog can also include technical debt (also known as design debt or code debt). This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

The sprint backlog

It is the list of work the development team must address during the next sprint. The list is derived by the scrum team progressively selecting product backlog items in priority order from the top of the product backlog until they feel they have enough work to fill the sprint. The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new-sprint, and use this as a guideline of how much 'effort' they can complete.
The product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their skills and capacity. This promotes the self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in.
The sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like to do, in progress, and done.
Once a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.

Increment

The increment is the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints. The increment must be complete according to the scrum team's definition of done, fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to deploy and use it.

Definition of done

Done criteria are a set of rules that apply to all user stories. A clear definition of done is critical because it removes ambiguity from requirements and helps the team adhere to mandatory quality norms. A User Story is considered done when it is demonstrated to and approved by the Product Owner who judges it based on the Done Criteria and the user story acceptance criteria.
